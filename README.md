# Exoesplorer-App-v1
NASA Hackathon https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/nasa-space-apps-2024/find-a-team/exoexplorer/?tab=project

This app features a main interface where users can access three key modes. First, a 3D simulation based on NASA's exoplanet database, accurately depicting stars as mentioned on the website. Additionally, there is a section called ExoGame, which includes a constellation memory game and a future integration of a story modeâ€”a 2D space adventure developed in Unity. From the main screen, there is also an Augmented Reality (AR) mode, which we were unable to integrate fully within the time constraints, but which will use the original simulation to render stars and draw constellations in 3D.

We are ExoExplorer, participating in the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024. Thank you!
